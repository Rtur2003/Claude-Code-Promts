## 🤖 NEW: Agent-Optimized Prompts

Specifically designed for autonomous AI coding agents like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and similar tools.

### Why Agent Prompts?

- **Token-Efficient**: Maximum value with minimal tokens
- **Autonomous**: Agents can work with minimal human intervention
- **Self-Correcting**: Built-in iteration loops catch and fix issues
- **Universal**: Work with any codebase or language
